### Instant View "Master Template" thing!
The mistake of humanity specifically for the contest.

# Pros:
* Fixing empty text() with $nbsp inside!
* Sometimes fixes twitter tweets!
* Replacing all //p/img with div!
* Getting all (+-) info from OpenGraph!
* #### Nesting correction (by [@mushi_f](https://t.me/mushi_f))!
# ~~Cons:~~
* ~~This template is perfect and works in 10 out of 10 templates!~~

# My template is empty! Ah!
* Just replace `body: //article` with your actual body on the site!
